## our project is "COVID-19 PNEUMONIA DETECTION USING CONVULUTUIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
## description: 
The Currently Available Immunizations Merely Lower The Severity Of The Symptoms,Not 
Prevent The Sickness, Making It Clearly Clear That Mankind Must Learn To Live With And 
Adapt To COVID-19. It Takes a Lot of Time and Money To Identify And Diagnose COVID-19 
Pneumonia Manually. But instead of requiring human intervention, automated diagnostics would 
provide real-time diagnosis, which would save costs. Given this, the goal of this research is to 
present a novel, optimal deep learning (DL) method that uses X-ray images for the automatic 
diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 pneumonia[5]. Because of this, we used a publicly 
available dataset of chest X-rays from Kaggle in our study. In an attempt to provide scholars a 
uniform set of COVID-19 component

## USE CASES
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 pneumonia detection has been explored in various medical imaging applications. CNNs excel in image classification tasks, making them well-suited for analyzing medical images such as chest X-rays and CT scans. Here are some common use cases for COVID-19 pneumonia detection using CNNs:
1. Automated Diagnosis: CNNs can be used to automate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia from chest X-ray or CT scan images. Trained CNN models can classify these images as either showing signs of COVID-19 pneumonia or not, aiding radiologists in making accurate and timely diagnoses.
2. Screening: CNN-based systems can assist in screening large volumes of chest imaging scans for COVID-19 pneumonia. By flagging potentially positive cases, these systems can prioritize which images require further review by healthcare professionals, thus optimizing workflow efficiency.
3. Monitoring Disease Progression: CNNs can track changes in chest imaging scans over time to monitor the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients. This longitudinal analysis can provide valuable insights into disease development and guide treatment decisions.
4. Assessment of Treatment Efficacy: By comparing chest imaging scans before and after treatment, CNNs can assess the effectiveness of different therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 pneumonia. This information can inform healthcare providers about the most suitable treatment strategies for individual patients.
